            Naruto Uzumaki is the main character of the Naruto manga and anime
            series. He was born during the Nine-Tailed Fox's attack on Konoha
            and was sealed with the fox to protect the village, but this led to
            his marginalization and loneliness during childhood. Despite this,
            Naruto aspires to become Hokage, the leader of the Leaf Village, and
            tries to prove his worth to his classmates and fellow citizens.
            Naruto is known for his cheerful, hyperactive, and stubborn
            attitude, and for his famous catchphrase "Believe it." He is a very
            simple character, easy to handle, and with a sunny personality. He
            has a dark side due to the tragedy of his past, but this does not
            prevent him from being an ideal hero. Throughout the series, Naruto
            befriends many characters, both foreign and from the Leaf Village,
            and eventually marries Hinata Hyuga, with whom he has two children,
            Himawari and Boruto. At the end of the series, Naruto becomes the
            seventh Hokage, realizing his dream.
